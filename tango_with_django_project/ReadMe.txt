Since my project commits are sort of all over the place I though I'd add a read me to explain.

All Chapters with exercises were completed within the deadlines excluding chapter 16-17 & chapter 21.

I wasn't sure whether I needed to complete the user profile part of the website and the lazy person that I am I thought since it wasn't in with the chapter 17 tutorial that we didn't have to do it.

However, after realizing we need to do it I have added it in and I understand that it is after the check in date.

The commits after the added user profile feature are just bugs I found during my lab and I thought I'd fix as I hadn't tested them. 

Also I had forgotten to commit chapter 15 before I started 16&17 therefore I commited again adding the "Chapter 15,16,17 - Completed" although this commit had made no changes the commit before also had the chapter 15 changes.

Apologies for the confused commits.
